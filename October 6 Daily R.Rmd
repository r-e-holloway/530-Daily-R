```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```{r}

lm(yield~N, data=npk)
lm(yield~P, data=npk)
lm(yield~K, data=npk)

fit1<-lm(yield~N+P+K+N*P+N*K+P*K+N*P*K, data=npk)
summary(fit1) #looks like treatment N (nitrogen) is related to the greatest crop yield, followed by the presences of all three treatments and then the treatment of potassium
```

I do not know how to visualize this or otherwise clean the data in such a way that 
I can do more than I already have, which is annoying. Tomorrow I'm going to try 
and learn some more about what I can do with the data.

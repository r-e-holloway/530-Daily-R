```{r}
Olympics #look at data
Olympics<- rename(Olympics, "Team" = "Team/NOC", "RBT" = "Rank by Total") #rename columns with multiple words
OlympicsAlpha <- Olympics[order(Olympics$Team),] #reorder rows alphabetically

#change character to numeric values: this failed
transform(OlympicsAlpha, Gold= as.numeric(Gold),
          Silver= as.numeric(Silver),
          Bronze= as.numeric(Bronze),
          Total= as.numeric(Total),
          RBT= as.numeric(RBT))


#split data into halves, organized alphabetically
AI<-OlympicsAlpha[c(1:44), c(1:7)]
JZ<-OlympicsAlpha[c(45:93), c(1:7)]

```
I was unable to change the character values (the numbers in my data set) to get R to recognize them as numeric, so I will not be doing any analysis of the data today. I'll try again with this dataset tomorrow.

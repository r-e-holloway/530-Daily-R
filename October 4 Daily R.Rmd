lm(Deaths~Species, data=snails)  #two species; B snails more likely to die than A

lm(Deaths~Exposure, data=snails) #exposure level 4 related to highest median snail deaths

I'm interested in seeing the number of snails in group B as compared to group A 
that received exposure 4. Will check that out tomorrow.
